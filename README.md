# Welcome_Chat

Hello there!, I am Kirthevasen K. I am learning to use websockets with sveltekit so I decided to create a simple chat application where users can

create their account and chat with anyone. I have a plan to upgrade it in near future. 

## Constraints

For this project `Socket.io and Socket.io-client` library is used for the bi-directional communication between client and server. As of now the sockets will work only in the **dev server**. To make sockets to work in production mode we need to use express and server and use sveltekit as middleware in it. In this project it is not yet done.

## Technologies Used
